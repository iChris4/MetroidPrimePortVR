// The Apple Vision Pro OpenXR provider (platform/vr/visionos).
//
// visionOS has no OpenXR runtime. The pacing thread (openxr_integration.cpp),
// the controller actions (openxr_input.cpp) and the swapchain protocol of every
// graphics backend are written against the OpenXR headers, so rather than
// rewrite them, this library implements the xr* entry points they call on top
// of CompositorServices (frames, drawables, the compositor) and ARKit (the
// device pose, the hands). It is linked in place of the Khronos loader
// (mp_openxr_visionos in CMakeLists.txt; ported from Wiicompiled VR) and speaks OpenXR 1.0 with
// XR_KHR_convert_timespec_time and XR_FB_display_refresh_rate.
//
// What OpenXR leaves to a graphics extension is declared here, as a private
// extension of this runtime's own:
//   - the layer renderer the SwiftUI ImmersiveSpace hands the app;
//   - the swapchain image type, an IOSurface with the MTLTexture that wraps it;
//   - the MTLSharedEvent hand-offs around an image (the compositor's last read
//     of it, Aurora's write into it), which play the part of sync fds on the
//     Quest;
//   - a per-frame environment switch: whether the room shows around the layers
//     (mixed immersion) or the frame is opaque.
// Every object handed across is a plain pointer so C++ code that never sees an
// Objective-C header can call this.
